# Employee Tracker

## Description

Employee Tracker is a command line application that uses MySQL to orchestrate an organized database for businesses to use as a way to keep records of their employees, professions, and more. The database uses relational data to allow cross referencing between different tables for easier usage.

## Requirements

- Code editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended)
- Command line terminal (GitBash, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.)
- Most recent version of Node.JS
- Most recent version on MySQL
- Node packages used in the project
- Clone the Employee Tracker project file onto your machine

## How to use

After gathering the necessary tools mentioned above, open the Employee Tracker project folder in your code editor. At this time, open your command line terminal and navigate to the root directory for Employee Tracker. You will first want to run the following code in your command line terminal, and sign into MySQL when prompted to do so: mysql -u (your mysql username) -p. After you have signed in, run the following code in order to create and populate the database: source db/schema.sql. Once you have finished signing into MySQL and populating the database, run the following command in a seperate command line window in order to start the app: npm start. This command will initate the server and display a menu asking the user what they would like to do next. From here the user will have free range to manage the databse how they would like.
